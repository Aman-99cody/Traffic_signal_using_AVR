# Traffic_signal_using_AVR
Project includes creating a traffic signal using AVR atmega 16 microcontroller with traffic lights  timer synchronized by using a 7 segment display .This project is actually meant to instruct the pedestrians while crossing a road at a Traffic Signal.

It involves an AVR Atmega 16 microcontroller , traffic lights 

A 7 segment display is also used to display timer for the traffic lights and a LCD to instruct the pedestrians while crossing the road.

This project involves a Software simulation on proteus (during Lockdown period)

Importance- A timing synchronised traffic light system  to avoid accidents

My role- To program code and design the circuit on proteus simulation Software

Challenge Faced- Synchronising the Delay of a 7 segment Display with traffic lights

Final outcome - Successful execution  of the Traffic light System with proper synchronisation of 7 segment Timer display
